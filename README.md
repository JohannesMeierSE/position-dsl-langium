# position-dsl-langium
Exploring Langium with a textual DSL for positions of elements in graphical diagrams


## Objectives and Context of this Project

* Main objective of this project is to learn Langium (https://langium.org/) for creating textual DSLs.
* Since Langium is web-based with TypeScript and VS Code extensions, secondary objectives are to learn the programming languages TypeScript and JavaScript as well as the IDE Visual Studio Code.
* Therefore, this project develops a new textual DSL with Langium and provides some custom functionalities (validation, code generation) around this DSL.


## Features of the DSL

TODO


## Validation of Constraints

* `Nodes` and `Edges` must have unique `names`.
* The `container` of a `PositionAlongEdge` must be a `TextElement`.


## Code Generation

TODO


## Technical Details of the DSL

* Extension name: position-diagram-dsl
* Language name: Positions in Diagrams
* File extensions: .posdia
